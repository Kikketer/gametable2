# Gameboard Table

> Bringing the tabletop experience to the table.

This is a simple experimental project based on my other Gameboard repo where I am attempting to combine two cheap monitors that I acquired into a tabletop game table.

The goal of this version is to use Tauri, Vite, Tailwind and DaisyUI to just learn those tools.
